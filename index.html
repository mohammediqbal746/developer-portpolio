                <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever. Some people may develop more
                    severe forms of the disease, such as pneumonia. The best way to confirm if you have the virus
                    producing
                    COVID-19 disease is with a laboratory test. You cannot confirm it with this breathing exercise,
                    which
                    can even be dangerous.
